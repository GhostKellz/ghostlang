## Performance Culture

**Principles:**
1. **Measure first**: No optimization without benchmarks
2. **User-focused**: Optimize common cases
3. **No regressions**: CI catches slowdowns
4. **Security never compromised**: Fast AND safe
5. **Pragmatic**: 80/20 rule - optimize what matters

**Mantras:**
- "Fast by default, safe always"
- "If it's not measured, it's not optimized"
- "The best optimization is not doing the work"
- "Security is not optional, slow is temporary"

## Performance FAQ

**Q: Why is v0.1.0 slower than Lua?**
A: We prioritized correctness and security first. v0.2.0 focuses on performance.

**Q: Will JIT hurt startup time?**
A: No - JIT is adaptive. Cold code stays interpreted.

**Q: Can I disable security for speed?**
A: Yes - trusted mode has zero overhead (v0.2.0+).

**Q: How do I benchmark my scripts?**
A: Use `zig build bench-string` as a template, add your scripts.

**Q: Is Ghostlang production-ready?**
A: Yes for GSH Beta. Performance will only improve.
