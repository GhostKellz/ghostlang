# Ghostlang Production Readiness Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Version Validated:** 0.2.0 + post-review hardening
**Maintainers:** Ghostlang Core Team

---

## Executive Summary

The critical runtime regressions called out in the original report are now fixed and guarded by automated tests. Array literals no longer leak or crash, script statement semantics are explicit about result ownership, and the CLI produces contextual memory diagnostics whenever scripts exhaust the allocator. Performance baselines have been captured with `zig build bench` so we can track regressions going forward.

**Production Readiness Status:** üü¢ **READY FOR PHANTOM.GRIM DEPLOYMENT**

Key improvements since the last audit:

- Eliminated the remaining array literal leak and the mysterious retain that caused segfaults when mixing variables.
- Added regression coverage for array ownership, table retention, and statement result semantics (`zig build test`).
- Clarified evaluation rules: pure statements now return `nil`, preventing hidden ownership transfers.
- Enhanced runtime diagnostics‚Äîmemory failures now emit a structured summary of globals and registers holding arrays/tables.
- Recorded performance and memory baselines (plugin load: 23‚ÄØ¬µs, script exec: 98‚ÄØ¬µs, API call: 26‚ÄØns, plugin overhead ‚âà‚ÄØ5‚ÄØKB).

## Critical Bugs (MUST FIX)

### 1. Memory Leak in Array Literals with Variables

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**What changed:**
- Array literal construction now retains exactly one instance per variable; registers are explicitly cleared when statements do not surface a value.
- Added regression tests (`array literal with variable retains ownership`, `array literal with multiple variables remains stable`) to lock the behaviour in place.
- Parser no longer treats assignment statements as expression results, preventing hidden references that previously escaped register cleanup.

**Verification:**
- `zig build test --summary all`
- Manual stress scripts pushing thousands of variable-backed array inserts show zero GPA leak reports.

**Outcome:** Array literals backed by variables are leak-free under repeated execution. Long-running Grim sessions no longer accumulate ghost references.

---

### 2. Segmentation Fault with Multiple Variables in Arrays

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**What changed:**
- Reconciled all retain/release paths for `ScriptArray` by auditing register moves and global assignments. The ‚Äúmystery retain‚Äù has been eliminated.
- Added targeted tests (`array literal with multiple variables remains stable`, `array reference shared across locals retains ownership`, `array stored in table maintains references`) that reproduce the previous crash scenario.
- Runtime now emits structured memory context if an allocator failure ever recurs, making future regressions easier to diagnose.

**Verification:**
- `zig build test --summary all`
- Manual reproduction scripts that previously crashed now exit cleanly and keep ref counts balanced.

**Outcome:** Arrays shared across locals, tables, and function boundaries are stable. The interpreter no longer segfaults under multi-variable array construction.

---

## High Priority Bugs

### 3. Expression Result Memory Management

**Severity:** üü° HIGH ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**What changed:**
- Parser tracks whether a statement produces a value; pure statements (e.g., `var name = "test"`) now return `nil` and release their registers immediately.
- Added regression test `assignment statement does not surface value` to ensure the CLI never advertises implicit ownership transfers again.
- Documentation below clarifies statement vs expression behaviour for plugin authors.

**Outcome:** Script authors get predictable ownership semantics and no longer see assignment results echoed as if they were expressions.

---

### 4. Array Reference Counting Edge Cases

**Severity:** üü° HIGH ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**What changed:**
- Comprehensive retain/release audit across VM operations, including array/table field setters and iterator paths.
- Added ownership regression tests covering shared locals, function returns, and table embedding (`array reference shared across locals retains ownership`, `array returned from function preserves lifetime`, `array stored in table maintains references`).
- New CLI memory diagnostics enumerate globals/registers holding arrays to assist in future investigations.

**Outcome:** Reference counts remain consistent across complex aliasing scenarios; assertions and tests provide early warning if this regresses.

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### 5. String Ownership in Collections

**Severity:** üü† MEDIUM ‚Üí ‚úÖ CLARIFIED

**Current State:**
- Strings remain copy-based (no reference counting), but the ownership rules are now documented for plugin authors:
   - Functions returning strings always allocate fresh copies.
   - `arrayPush`/`objectSet` take ownership of the provided value.
   - Global declarations duplicate string data to keep script and host lifetimes separate.
- Additional profiling hooks are in place so we can evaluate interning opportunities in future releases.

**Next Steps:**
- Consider optional string interning once broader performance work begins (tracked separately).

---

### 6. Error Messages for Memory Issues

**Severity:** üü† MEDIUM ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**What changed:**
- The CLI now prints a "memory context" block whenever execution fails due to `OutOfMemory` or `MemoryLimitExceeded`. It enumerates globals and registers that still hold arrays/tables (with lengths and ref counts) and provides remediation hints.
- Additional runtime helpers make it straightforward to extend the diagnostics if new data types need coverage.

**Sample Output:**
```
error: script 'plugin.gza' failed: MemoryLimitExceeded
   memory context:
      - global 'result': array len=12 ref_count=2
      - register r4: array len=12 ref_count=2
   hint: Investigate the references above; release or reuse these values to prevent leaks.
```

## Low Priority / Nice to Have

### 7. Performance Optimization

**Status:** üü¢ FUTURE

**Areas:**
- String allocation overhead
- Array resizing strategy
- Register allocation efficiency
- Constant folding/optimization

### 8. Missing Stdlib Features

**Status:** üü¢ FUTURE

Already documented in `archive/GHOSTLANG_POLISH_OCTOBER.md`:
- `table.sort()` not implemented
- `table.insert()` not implemented (use `push()` instead)
- `ipairs()` partially working
- Limited string manipulation functions

---

## Testing Requirements

All suites below are now automated as part of `zig build test`. New regressions must keep these cases green.

### Required Test Suite for Production:

#### Array Literal Tests:
```ghostlang
-- Test empty array
local empty = []

-- Test literals only
local literals = [1, "two", 3.0, true]

-- Test single variable
local x = 5
local single = [x]

-- Test multiple variables  (CURRENTLY FAILS)
local a = 1
local b = 2
local c = 3
local multi = [a, b, c]

-- Test mixed literals and variables  (CURRENTLY FAILS)
local y = "var"
local mixed = ["lit", y, 42]

-- Test nested arrays
local nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

-- Test with concatenation
local name = "test"
local str = "prefix_" .. name
local arr = [str]
```

#### Memory Management Tests:
```ghostlang
-- Test array sharing
local arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
local arr2 = arr1
-- Verify ref_count=2

-- Test array mutation
local arr = [1, 2]
push(arr, 3)
-- Verify original array updated

-- Test array in table
local obj = {data = [1, 2, 3]}
local copy = obj.data
push(copy, 4)
-- Verify both see the change
```

#### Stress Tests:
```ghostlang
-- Test large arrays
local big = []
for i = 1, 10000 do
    push(big, i)
end

-- Test many small arrays
for i = 1, 1000 do
    local temp = [i, i*2, i*3]
end

-- Test deep nesting
local deep = [[[[[[[[[[1]]]]]]]]]]
```

## Memory Model Snapshot

- **Statements vs expressions:** Only true expressions surface results. Assignments, declarations, and control-flow headers evaluate to `nil`, ensuring registers clean up immediately.
- **Arrays and tables:** Reference counted with deterministic retain/release. Diagnostics expose ref counts per global/register when memory pressure occurs.
- **Strings:** Always copied on ownership transfers. Collection helpers (`arrayPush`, `objectSet`) take ownership; retrieving values returns fresh copies for safety.

## Performance Baseline (October 23, 2025)

Collected via `zig build bench` (ReleaseFast targets on Linux):

| Benchmark | Target | Observed |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Plugin Loading Speed | < 100‚ÄØ¬µs | **23‚ÄØ¬µs** (23‚ÄØ140‚ÄØns) |
| Simple Script Execution | < 1‚ÄØms | **98‚ÄØ¬µs** |
| FFI/API Call Overhead | < 10‚ÄØ¬µs | **26‚ÄØns** |
| Per-Plugin Memory Overhead | < 50‚ÄØKB | **‚âà‚ÄØ5‚ÄØKB** |

These numbers will serve as the regression baseline for upcoming RC1 work.

## Recommended Practices

With the fixes in place, all previously restricted patterns are safe. The guidelines below summarise the *preferred* approaches rather than mandatory workarounds:

### ‚úÖ **Prefer:**
```ghostlang
-- Use clear ownership when populating arrays
var items = []
for plugin in registry do
   arrayPush(items, plugin)
end

-- Reuse tables and arrays instead of recreating them hot
var state = {
   loaded = {},
   history = []
}

-- Return arrays from helper functions when sharing ownership intentionally
function collect()
   return ["alpha", "beta"]
end
```

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è **You May Also:**
```ghostlang
-- Mix literals and variables in array literals
var name = "ghost"
var arr = ["prefix", name]

-- Build arrays incrementally with arrayPush/arraySet
var dynamic = []
for i = 1, count do
   arrayPush(dynamic, i)
end

-- Pass arrays through tables and functions safely
var registry = { items = dynamic }
var copy = registry.items
```

## Conclusion

Ghostlang 0.2.0 (with the latest hardening commits) now meets the production-readiness bar for phantom.grim:

1. Arrays no longer leak or crash under variable-heavy workloads.
2. Ownership semantics are explicit and documented.
3. Memory diagnostics and performance baselines give us guardrails against regressions.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ship with phantom.grim. Continue tracking performance optimisations and ecosystem work through the RC1 roadmap.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Keep `zig build test` and `zig build bench` in CI to prevent regressions.
2. Begin Phase A (Testing & Hardening) from the RC1 roadmap using the new baselines.
3. Solicit plugin author feedback on the clarified memory model and diagnostics.
