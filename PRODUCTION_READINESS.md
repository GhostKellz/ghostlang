# Ghostlang Production Readiness Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Version Tested:** 0.2.0
**Tested By:** Claude (phantom.grim integration work)

---

## Executive Summary

Ghostlang 0.2.0 has **critical memory management bugs** that make it unsuitable for production use. While basic functionality works, array operations with variables have memory leaks and segmentation faults that will cause crashes in real-world applications.

**Production Readiness Status:** 🔴 **NOT READY**

---

## Critical Bugs (MUST FIX)

### 1. Memory Leak in Array Literals with Variables

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED (reduced from 2 leaks to 1)

**Problem:**
When creating array literals with variables, each variable reference leaks memory.

**Test Case:**
```ghostlang
local name = "test"
local arr = [name]
print(arr)
```

**Result:**
- **Before fix:** 2 memory leaks per variable
- **After partial fix:** 1 memory leak per variable
- **Production requirement:** 0 memory leaks

**Error Output:**
```
error(gpa): memory address 0x741fd1660060 leaked:
/data/projects/ghostlang/src/root.zig:2171 (load_const)
```

**Root Cause:**
String values are copied multiple times:
1. Load constant "test" into register (allocation A)
2. Store in global variable "name" (copies to allocation B)
3. Load from global for array literal (copies to allocation C)
4. C gets moved to array, A and B get freed, but something still leaks

**Impact:**
- Long-running scripts will slowly consume memory
- Config files that build arrays dynamically will leak
- Unacceptable for phantom.grim production use

**Fix Required:**
- Investigate why load_const allocation isn't being freed
- May need to track assignment expression results differently
- Possibly related to how script return values are handled

---

### 2. Segmentation Fault with Multiple Variables in Arrays

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Status:** UNFIXED (pre-existing bug)

**Problem:**
Creating arrays with 2 or more variables causes segmentation fault during cleanup.

**Test Case:**
```ghostlang
local a = "hello"
local b = "world"
local arr = [a, b]
print(arr)
```

**Result:**
```
<array>
Result: <array>
Segmentation fault at address 0x71cc5d380028
/data/projects/ghostlang/src/root.zig:334:17: in release (root.zig)
        if (self.ref_count == 0) return;
```

**Root Cause (CONFIRMED):**
Use-after-free bug in reference counting:

1. Array created with ref_count=1
2. `store_global "arr"` retains -> ref_count=2 (register + global)
3. Register cleanup releases -> ref_count=1
4. `load_global "arr"` for print retains -> ref_count=2
5. **Mystery retain** -> ref_count=3 (SOURCE UNKNOWN!)
6. Three releases bring ref_count to 0 -> **ARRAY FREED**
7. Global cleanup tries to release again -> **USE-AFTER-FREE SEGFAULT**

Debug output shows:
```
DEBUG: created array 0x... with ref_count=1
DEBUG: array 0x... retained: 1 -> 2  (store_global)
DEBUG: release() called -> ref_count: 2 -> 1
DEBUG: array 0x... retained: 1 -> 2  (load_global for print)
DEBUG: array 0x... retained: 2 -> 3  (??? MYSTERY RETAIN)
DEBUG: release() called -> ref_count: 3 -> 2
DEBUG: release() called -> ref_count: 2 -> 1
DEBUG: release() called -> ref_count: 1 -> 0
DEBUG: freeing array 0x... with 2 items
DEBUG: array freed completely
DEBUG: release() called on array 0x...  (USE-AFTER-FREE!)
Segmentation fault at address 0x...0028
```

The bug is:
- There's an extra `retain()` call (step 5) from unknown source
- Total: 3 explicit retains + 1 initial = should be 4 releases
- But array gets freed at release #3, and global cleanup does release #4
- This means one of the retains didn't register properly, or there's a missing retain

**Impact:**
- **CRASHES THE INTERPRETER**
- Any script with multiple variables in an array will crash
- Completely blocks dynamic array building in production
- Makes Ghostlang unusable for real configuration files

**Fix Required:**
- Find source of mystery retain at step 5
  - Check if print() or function calls do extra retains
  - Check if result handling retains arrays
  - Add logging to ALL retain() calls with stack traces
- Fix ref_count to match actual ownership
- Add assertions: every retain() must have corresponding release()
- Consider adding GC or ownership tracking to prevent this class of bugs

**Workaround:**
Use array literals with constants only:
```ghostlang
-- Works fine
local arr = ["hello", "world"]

-- Crashes
local a = "hello"
local b = "world"
local arr = [a, b]
```

## High Priority Bugs

### 3. Expression Result Memory Management

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH
**Status:** UNFIXED

**Problem:**
Assignment expressions return their values, which creates ambiguity about ownership.

**Example:**
```ghostlang
local name = "test"  -- Returns "test"
```

The CLI shows `Result: test` even though this is a statement, not an expression.

**Issues:**
- Unclear who owns the returned value
- May be related to the memory leak in bug #1
- No clear distinction between statements and expressions

**Fix Required:**
- Clarify expression vs statement semantics
- Document ownership rules for returned values
- Possibly separate "script result" from "last expression value"

---

### 4. Array Reference Counting Edge Cases

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH
**Status:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Problem:**
Arrays use reference counting, but there may be edge cases where ref_count gets out of sync.

**Evidence:**
- Segfault in bug #2 suggests ref_count corruption
- Double-free protection exists for strings but not arrays
- No clear documentation of when retain()/release() should be called

**Test Cases Needed:**
```ghostlang
-- Test 1: Array in multiple variables
local arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
local arr2 = arr1
local arr3 = arr1
-- All three should reference same array with ref_count=3

-- Test 2: Array passed to function
function process(arr)
    return arr
end
local result = process([1, 2, 3])
-- Check ref_count management across function calls

-- Test 3: Array in table
local obj = { items = [1, 2, 3] }
local copy = obj.items
-- Verify ref_count increments properly
```

**Fix Required:**
- Audit all array operations for correct retain()/release() calls
- Add assertions to verify ref_count never goes negative
- Add tests for complex array ownership scenarios
- Document ref_counting rules clearly

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### 5. String Ownership in Collections

**Severity:** 🟠 MEDIUM
**Status:** NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Problem:**
Strings are NOT reference counted, so ownership transfer must be explicit.

**Current Behavior:**
- `arrayAppend()` NOW takes ownership (after fix)
- `declareVariable()` copies strings
- `load_global` copies strings
- Lots of copying, lots of allocations

**Issues:**
- High memory overhead for string-heavy workloads
- Unclear when strings are copied vs moved
- No string interning or deduplication

**Fix Required:**
- Document string ownership rules clearly
- Consider string interning for constants
- Add move semantics where appropriate
- Profile and optimize string-heavy workloads

---

### 6. Error Messages for Memory Issues

**Severity:** 🟠 MEDIUM
**Status:** UNFIXED

**Problem:**
When memory leaks or crashes occur, error messages don't help users fix their code.

**Current Output:**
```
error(gpa): memory address 0x741fd1660060 leaked
```

Users see memory addresses, not helpful context about WHAT leaked or WHY.

**Fix Required:**
- Add script-level context to memory errors
- Show which line/variable caused the issue
- Provide suggestions for fixing common patterns
- Better integration with GPA leak detection

---

## Low Priority / Nice to Have

### 7. Performance Optimization

**Status:** 🟢 FUTURE

**Areas:**
- String allocation overhead
- Array resizing strategy
- Register allocation efficiency
- Constant folding/optimization

### 8. Missing Stdlib Features

**Status:** 🟢 FUTURE

Already documented in `archive/GHOSTLANG_POLISH_OCTOBER.md`:
- `table.sort()` not implemented
- `table.insert()` not implemented (use `push()` instead)
- `ipairs()` partially working
- Limited string manipulation functions

---

## Testing Requirements

### Required Test Suite for Production:

#### Array Literal Tests:
```ghostlang
-- Test empty array
local empty = []

-- Test literals only
local literals = [1, "two", 3.0, true]

-- Test single variable
local x = 5
local single = [x]

-- Test multiple variables  (CURRENTLY FAILS)
local a = 1
local b = 2
local c = 3
local multi = [a, b, c]

-- Test mixed literals and variables  (CURRENTLY FAILS)
local y = "var"
local mixed = ["lit", y, 42]

-- Test nested arrays
local nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

-- Test with concatenation
local name = "test"
local str = "prefix_" .. name
local arr = [str]
```

#### Memory Management Tests:
```ghostlang
-- Test array sharing
local arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
local arr2 = arr1
-- Verify ref_count=2

-- Test array mutation
local arr = [1, 2]
push(arr, 3)
-- Verify original array updated

-- Test array in table
local obj = {data = [1, 2, 3]}
local copy = obj.data
push(copy, 4)
-- Verify both see the change
```

#### Stress Tests:
```ghostlang
-- Test large arrays
local big = []
for i = 1, 10000 do
    push(big, i)
end

-- Test many small arrays
for i = 1, 1000 do
    local temp = [i, i*2, i*3]
end

-- Test deep nesting
local deep = [[[[[[[[[[1]]]]]]]]]]
```

## Current Workarounds for Production

Until bugs are fixed, phantom.grim must use these workarounds:

### ✅ **DO:**
```ghostlang
-- Use array literals with constants
local items = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]

-- Build strings before adding to arrays
local m1 = "plugins." .. name
local items = [m1]  -- Only 1 variable, acceptable

-- Use empty arrays in tables
local state = {
    loaded = {},
    history = []  -- Empty is fine
}
```

### ❌ **DON'T:**
```ghostlang
-- Multiple variables in arrays (CRASHES)
local a = "test1"
local b = "test2"
local arr = [a, b]  -- SEGFAULT

-- Building arrays with push() (HIGH LEAK)
local arr = []
for item in items do
    push(arr, item)  -- LEAKS
end

-- Dynamic array construction (LEAKS)
local result = []
for i = 1, count do
    local item = "item_" .. i
    push(result, item)  -- LEAKS
end
```

## Conclusion

Ghostlang 0.2.0 is **NOT production-ready** due to:
1. Segmentation fault with multiple variables (CRITICAL)
2. Memory leaks in array operations (CRITICAL)

**Minimum fixes required before production:**
- Fix segfault in bug #2 (MUST FIX)
- Reduce memory leaks to zero in bug #1 (MUST FIX)
- Add comprehensive test suite (REQUIRED)

**Estimated work:** 2-3 weeks for critical fixes + testing

**Status:** Use workarounds in phantom.grim, but plan to fix Ghostlang properly for v0.3.0 release.
