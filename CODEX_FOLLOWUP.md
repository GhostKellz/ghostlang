# Ghostlang Grove Integration CODEX

## Post-MVP Integration Roadmap

This document outlines the integration work required in Ghostlang once Grove achieves post-MVP status and enters the Alpha/Beta phases.

## Integration Timeline & Dependencies

### Alpha Phase Prerequisites (Grove Side)
- Grove achieves rope delta translation and incremental parsing
- Query compilation and highlight prototype operational
- CLI smoke tool functional
- Basic async scheduling via Zsync

### Beta Phase Prerequisites (Grove Side)
- Full highlight pipeline operational
- Ghostlang plugin scaffolding available
- Multi-file parse queue with async scheduling
- Benchmark harness with regression thresholds

## Ghostlang Integration Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation Integration (Post-MVP)

#### 1.1 Build System Integration
- [ ] Add Grove as dependency in Ghostlang's build.zig
- [ ] Configure static library linking for Tree-sitter runtime
- [ ] Ensure cross-platform builds (Linux/macOS/Windows x64)
- [ ] Set up CI integration for Grove dependency updates

#### 1.2 Core API Wrappers
- [ ] Create Ghostlang-native wrappers around Grove's core APIs
  - Parser initialization and management
  - Tree and Node access patterns
  - Query compilation interfaces
- [ ] Implement error handling patterns consistent with Ghostlang conventions
- [ ] Add memory management integration with Ghostlang's allocator strategy

#### 1.3 Language Grammar Support
- [ ] Integrate Zig grammar for Ghostlang tooling
- [ ] Add support for additional languages as needed:
  - JSON (configuration files)
  - TypeScript/JavaScript (web integration)
  - Python (script interop)
  - Rust (performance-critical modules)

### Phase 2: Tooling Integration (Alpha)

#### 2.1 Syntax Analysis Services
- [ ] Implement AST traversal utilities for Ghostlang scripts
- [ ] Create syntax validation services for runtime script checking
- [ ] Build semantic analysis helpers for variable scope tracking
- [ ] Add structural matching APIs for pattern-based transformations

#### 2.2 Developer Tooling
- [ ] Integrate syntax highlighting for Ghostlang editor support
- [ ] Build incremental parsing for live editing scenarios
- [ ] Create diagnostic services (syntax errors, warnings)
- [ ] Implement code formatting utilities

#### 2.3 Linting & Analysis Framework
- [ ] Create rule-based linting engine using Grove queries
- [ ] Implement code quality metrics collection
- [ ] Build refactoring suggestion system
- [ ] Add dead code detection capabilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Beta)

#### 3.1 Runtime Integration
- [ ] Embed Grove parsing in Ghostlang script execution pipeline
- [ ] Create sandbox-safe APIs for script-driven parsing
- [ ] Implement background parsing for large codebases
- [ ] Add incremental compilation support using syntax trees

#### 3.2 Plugin Architecture
- [ ] Design plugin API for external syntax extensions
- [ ] Create plugin scaffolding system using Grove's foundation
- [ ] Implement plugin sandboxing with Grove's safe APIs
- [ ] Build plugin marketplace integration

#### 3.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Integrate Grove's async scheduling for non-blocking operations
- [ ] Implement parse result caching strategies
- [ ] Add multi-threaded parsing for large files
- [ ] Create memory-efficient tree streaming for huge codebases

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (RC)

#### 4.1 API Stabilization
- [ ] Freeze Ghostlang-Grove integration APIs
- [ ] Create migration guides for breaking changes
- [ ] Establish backward compatibility guarantees
- [ ] Document all public interfaces

#### 4.2 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration test suite
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for parse operations
- [ ] Add performance regression testing
- [ ] Create fuzzing harness for script parsing edge cases

#### 4.3 Documentation
- [ ] Write integration guides for Ghostlang developers
- [ ] Create API reference documentation
- [ ] Build example applications demonstrating Grove usage
- [ ] Document best practices for performance and safety

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points
```
Ghostlang Runtime
├── Script Parser (Grove-powered)
├── Syntax Validator (Grove queries)
├── Code Formatter (Grove AST)
├── Linting Engine (Grove pattern matching)
└── Plugin System (Grove-based extensions)
```

### API Surface
- `ghostlang.syntax.*` - Core syntax tree operations
- `ghostlang.lint.*` - Linting and analysis tools
- `ghostlang.format.*` - Code formatting utilities
- `ghostlang.refactor.*` - Refactoring and transformation APIs
- `ghostlang.plugin.*` - Plugin development framework

## Quality Gates & Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Parse latency: <10ms for typical Ghostlang scripts
- Memory overhead: <5% increase over baseline
- Incremental parse: <1ms for single-line edits
- Plugin load time: <50ms for syntax extensions

### Reliability Requirements
- Zero memory leaks in parsing pipeline
- Graceful degradation for malformed syntax
- Async operations must be cancellable
- Plugin crashes must not affect runtime

### Integration Quality
- API compatibility with Grove updates
- Seamless developer experience
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Performance parity with native alternatives

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Grove API instability | Medium | High | Pin to specific Grove versions, maintain adapter layer |
| Performance regression | Low | High | Continuous benchmarking, performance budget enforcement |
| Memory leaks | Medium | Critical | Extensive testing, memory profiling in CI |
| Plugin security issues | High | Medium | Strict sandboxing, security audit process |
| Breaking changes in Tree-sitter | Low | Medium | Version pinning, upstream monitoring |

## Success Definition

Post-MVP Grove integration is successful when:
1. Ghostlang scripts can be parsed and analyzed using Grove APIs
2. Developer tooling (linting, formatting) operates on Grove syntax trees
3. Plugin system enables third-party syntax extensions
4. Performance meets or exceeds current baseline
5. Integration is transparent to existing Ghostlang users
6. Documentation enables rapid adoption by community
